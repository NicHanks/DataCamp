    "Yes, Plotly is different from Matplotlib. Here are some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactivity**:\n",
    "   - **Plotly**: Highly interactive, allowing for zooming, panning, and hovering over data points to see more information.\n",
    "   - **Matplotlib**: Primarily static plots, though interactivity can be added with additional libraries like `mpld3` or `plotly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ease of Use**:\n",
    "   - **Plotly**: Often considered easier for creating complex, interactive plots with less code.\n",
    "   - **Matplotlib**: More control over plot customization, but can require more code for complex plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Formats**:\n",
    "   - **Plotly**: Can output to web-based formats (HTML), making it easy to share interactive plots.\n",
    "   - **Matplotlib**: Outputs to static formats like PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **3D Plotting**:\n",
    "   - **Plotly**: Built-in support for 3D plotting.\n",
    "   - **Matplotlib**: 3D plotting is available but requires the `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Community and Ecosystem**:\n",
    "   - **Plotly**: Has a growing ecosystem with Dash for creating web applications.\n",
    "   - **Matplotlib**: A mature library with a large community and many extensions like `seaborn` for statistical plots.\n",
